WELCOME TO THE POKEMON BATTLE!
------

While learning about OOP practices and working with modules in Python, I wanted to practice by making a game to test what I had learned.
This is just a fun Python-based console application that allows a user to play against the computer in a head-to-head Pokemon battle.

### To-Dos:
1. Add input error checking

#### Wish-List:
* Add more Pokemon to choose from
* Add type-effectiveness (e.g. "Thundershock" is super effective on Water-types)
* Add status-afflicting moves (e.g. "Sleep Powder" renders the opponent asleep and they miss a few chances to attack)
* Add more item types to choose from besides "Potions"
